- 👋 Hi, I’m @z0onic
- 👀 I’m interested in anythign with computers and coding. Not sure where I will land on this, I enjoy the web design I have learned so far and the mechanics behind the hardware of a computer as well. Just going to keep exploring until I find my happy place.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning I guess from end design. I've covered the basics so its more I'm learing by takling some projects on my own, outside of tutorials or classes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: not really sure yet. I guess I'm looking to learn about collaborating
- 📫 How to reach me: can you message me here? Lets be honest no one is reading this at my current level of output here so more comming I guess.
